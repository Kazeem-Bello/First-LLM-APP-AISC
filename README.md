# First-LLM-APP-AISC
Not sure if integration is the word, but to test the API:
- run app.py in your terminal using uvicorn
- The local host and port become active and the API server is listening to them for requests
- Send a request to this host and port in postman - replicate how it was done in the tutorial
uvicorn app:app --reload
